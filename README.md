# CS3005_Game
A dungeon crawler game to teach Maths to kids. Created using Visual Studio 2010/12 with XNA in C# for my Computer Science module Digital Media And Games (CS3005).

The game's framework is designed on a grid placement system for the ease of creation of levels, and has an easy way to create all necessary objects for levels. Due to my recent experience in creating a Minecraft mod, it helped the way designed my classes which allowed me to have a well structured game which is easy for me to modify and add to.
